Bash is said to be the opposite of riding the bike -- you have to re-learn it every time. So if we're doing anything more complex than running a few commands, chances are google will be needed. But if we switch to python, then the reverse is true -- python is a bit too cumbersome for simple scripts. I try to alleviate this problem by making it easier to use bash from python.
